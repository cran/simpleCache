Title: Simply Caching R Objects
Description: Provides intuitive functions for caching R objects, encouraging
    reproducible, restartable, and distributed R analysis. The user selects a
    location to store caches, and then provides  nothing more than a cache name
    and instructions (R code) for how to produce the R object. Also
    provides some advanced options like environment assignments, recreating or
    reloading caches, and cluster compute bindings (using the 'batchtools'
    package) making it flexible enough for use in large-scale data analysis
    projects.
